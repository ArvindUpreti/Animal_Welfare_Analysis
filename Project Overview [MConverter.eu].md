# Project Overview

The Dashboard for Animal Welfare is here! The purpose of this dashboard
is to present important information about animal welfare in different
regions in an understandable and concise manner. Allow me to take you
over the highlights and what to expect from this site.  
  
1. Title and Objective  
The headline \"Animal Welfare Dashboard\" and the subtitle \"Voices for
the Voiceless: Protect Our Animals\" are shown at the top of the
dashboard. This lays the foundation for the dashboard\'s main message,
which is to advocate for animal preservation and draw attention to the
suffering of animals around the world.

2\. Overview of Key Metrics  
A section outlining some important metrics will be among the first
things you notice:  
  
Total Nations: The number of nations in our data set is displayed by
this measure. It helps us understand the extent of the problem and the
data\'s global reach.  
Overall Count of Animal Deaths (Up to 2022): This figure is very
important. It shows the total number of animals euthanized till the end
of 2022. This number is essential to comprehending the scope of the
problem we\'re facing.

  
3. Localized Perspectives  
The following regional analysis will assist in identifying areas of
concern:  
  
Top 3 Continents with the Highest Rates of Animal Death: This section
presents a map or bar chart that may be used to illustrate which
continents have the highest rates of animal murders. We can rapidly
determine which areas need the most immediate attention and intervention
thanks to this visualization.

  
4. Charts and Indicators  
We also incorporate several graphic components that offer a more
thorough analysis of the data:  
  
Trends Over Time: There are line graphs that show the patterns in the
deaths of animals over time. This aids in determining whether conditions
are improving or deteriorating over time, which is essential for
assessing the effectiveness of any interventions.

Data is presented in pie charts or bar graphs according to animal
species, manner of death, and other categories. Our understanding of the
problem\'s details, including which animal species are most impacted and
how, is improved by these images.

5. Request for Action
A call to action is included on the dashboard at the end.
Our goal is to inspire, not just to educate.
To help protect our creatures, this section urges viewers to become engaged through advocacy, donations, or direct action.
